# BTCUSDT 1-Hour Fine-tuned Model

## Model Description

This is a fine-tuned language model adapted for **Bitcoin (BTCUSDT) price and volume forecasting** on 1-hour candlestick data. The model has been specialized to predict short-term price movements and trading volume patterns.

### Base Model

- **Base Model**: [Kronos](https://huggingface.co/antonop/Kronos-1B-MSN) (or specify your actual base model)
- **Fine-tuning Task**: Time Series Forecasting for Cryptocurrency
- **Application**: BTC/USDT hourly price prediction

### Model Details

- **Model Type**: Fine-tuned Transformer-based Time Series Model
- **Input**: Historical BTCUSDT 1-hour candlestick data (open, high, low, close, volume)
- **Output**: Predicted price and volume for the next period(s)
- **Fine-tuning Data**: Historical BTCUSDT 1-hour trading data
- **Framework**: PyTorch / Hugging Face Transformers

## Intended Use

This model is designed for:
- **Short-term Bitcoin price forecasting** (1-hour predictions)
- **Trading volume estimation**
- **Technical analysis automation**
- **Research and backtesting**

### Intended Users

- Cryptocurrency traders and analysts
- Quantitative research teams
- Academic researchers studying time series forecasting
- Trading strategy developers

## How to Use

### Installation

```bash
pip install transformers torch
```

### Loading the Model

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

model_name = "your-huggingface-username/BTCUSDT-1h-finetuned"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
```

### Prediction Example

```python
# Prepare your BTCUSDT data
# Use the prediction script from the original repository

from prediction_script import predict_btc
predictions = predict_btc(model, historical_data)
print(predictions)
```

For detailed usage, see the [original repository](https://github.com/your-username/Kronos-Btc-finetune)

## Model Performance

- **Training Data**: BTCUSDT 1-hour historical candles
- **Evaluation Metric**: Model-specific forecasting accuracy
- **Use Case Specific**: Optimized for cryptocurrency time series

See example predictions:

## Limitations

- Trained specifically on **BTCUSDT 1-hour data** - may not generalize to other cryptocurrencies or timeframes
- Time series models are inherently uncertain; predictions should not be used as sole basis for trading decisions
- Market conditions and volatility can significantly impact forecast accuracy
- Historical performance does not guarantee future results

## Ethical Considerations

⚠️ **Risk Warning**: This model is for research and educational purposes. Do not use for actual trading without proper risk management and professional financial advice.

- Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile
- Use appropriate position sizing and stop-loss strategies
- Consult with financial professionals before trading decisions
